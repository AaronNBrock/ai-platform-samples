# AI Platform training

The AI Platform training service allows you to train models using a wide range of different customization options.

You can select many different machine types to power your training jobs, enable distributed training, use hyperparameter 
tuning, and accelerate with GPUs and TPUs.

You can also select different ways to customize your training application. You can submit your input data for AI 
Platform to train using a built-in algorithm (beta).
If the built-in algorithms do not fit your use case, you can submit your own training application to run on AI Platform, 
or build a custom container (beta) with your training application and its dependencies to run on AI Platform.

This folder covers different functionality available in different frameworks:

 - Running a training job
 - Distributed training
 - Using GPUs
 - Using TPUs
 - Hyperparameter tuning
