# AI Platform Prediction

You can host your trained machine learning models on AI Platform for predictions (inference) from new examples.

Currently, AI Platform can serve models generated by [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

## Steps to Deploy

To deploy a model on AI Platform to be served, there are two general steps that need be taken:

1. Create a model resource: A model resource is like a folder for all different versions of a model.

2. Create a model version: Once a model resource is created, the model object is uploaded to AI Platform, 
along with a version. 


## Make Prediction

After a model version is created, it can be used to make predictions through a simple Python API.

We will show the details of all the required steps in the samples in this directory.
