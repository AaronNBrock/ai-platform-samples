## Taxi Trips Dataset

The [Taxi Trips Dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew) wasreleased by the City of Chicago.

the dataset in [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/). Explore
the full dataset in the
[BigQuery UI](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/bigquery-public-data:chicago_taxi_trips).


The dataset in BigQuery is in a raw format. We have processed the dataset to prepare it for model training.

We have two different sizes of the dataset:

* Big: With 1M samples for training and 200K samples for evaluation
* Small: With 10K samples for training and 2K samples for evaluation

You can download either dataset (or both) by running one of the two following scripts:

```bash
# To download the both datasets:
source ./download-taxi.sh /path/to/output/directory

# To download the big dataset only:
source ./download-taxi.sh /path/to/output/directory big

# To download the small dataset only:
source ./download-taxi.sh /path/to/output/directory small
```

Upon succession, the relevant datasets are downloaded and some or all of the
following environment variables properly exported:

* Local Datasets for Training:
  * TAXI_TRAIN_BIG: Local path to the big training dataset
  * TAXI_EVAL_BIG: Local path to the big evaluation dataset
  * TAXI_TRAIN_SMALL: Local path to the small training dataset
  * TAXI_EVAL_SMALL: Local path to the small evaluation dataset
* GCS Datasets for Training:
  * GCS_TAXI_BIG: GCS path to the big training+evaluation dataset
  * GCS_TAXI_TRAIN_BIG: GCS path to the big training dataset
  * GCS_TAXI_EVAL_BIG: GCS path to the big evaluation dataset
  * GCS_TAXI_SMALL: GCS path to the small training+evaluation dataset
  * GCS_TAXI_TRAIN_SMALL: GCS path to the small training dataset
  * GCS_TAXI_EVAL_SMALL: GCS path to the small evaluation dataset
* Prediction Datasets:
  * TAXI_PREDICTION_DICT_NDJSON: a Newline Delimited JSON file with 3 samples, represented as dictionaries
  * TAXI_PREDICTION_LIST_NDJSON: a Newline Delimited JSON file with 3 samples, represented as lists

Note: Each line in a Newline Delimited JSON file is a JSON object or list.
