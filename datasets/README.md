The dataset in BigQuery is in a raw format. We have processed the dataset a little to prepare it for model training. 

We have two different sizes of the dataset:

* Big: With 1M samples for training and 200K samples for evaluation
* Small: With 10K samples for training and 2K samples for evaluation

You can download either dataset (or both) by running one of the two following scripts:
```bash
# To download the both datasets:
source ./download-taxi.sh /path/to/output/directory

# To download the big dataset only:
source ./download-taxi.sh /path/to/output/directory big

# To download the small dataset only:
source ./download-taxi.sh /path/to/output/directory small
```

following environment variables properly exported:

* Local Datasets for Training:
  * TAXI_TRAIN_BIG
