the dataset in [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/). Explore
the full dataset in the
[BigQuery UI](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/bigquery-public-data:chicago_taxi_trips).


The dataset in BigQuery is in a raw format. We have processed the dataset to prepare it for model training.

We have two different sizes of the dataset:

* Cloud: With 1M samples for training and 200K samples for evaluation
* Local: With 10K samples for local training and 2K samples for local evaluation

You can download either dataset (or both) by running one of the two following scripts:

```bash
# To download the both datasets:
source ./download-taxi.sh /path/to/output/directory

# To download the Cloud dataset only:
source ./download-taxi.sh /path/to/output/directory cloud

# To download the Local dataset only:
source ./download-taxi.sh /path/to/output/directory local
```

There are two additional files when you run the download script:

* [taxi_trips_prediction.txt](https://storage.cloud.google.com/cloud-samples-data/ml-engine/chicago_taxi/prediction/taxi_trips_prediction.txt): a header-less CSV file with 3 samples in a list, ready to be used for prediction
* [taxi_trips_prediction.json](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-samples-data/ml-engine/chicago_taxi/prediction/taxi_trips_prediction_list.json): a JSON file with 3 samples, ready to be used for prediction

The script also sets the following environment variables properly:

* [CLOUD_TAXI_TRAINING](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-samples-data/ml-engine/chicago_taxi/cloud/taxi_trips_train.csv): path to the Cloud training dataset
* [CLOUD_TAXI_EVALUATION](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-samples-data/ml-engine/chicago_taxi/cloud/taxi_trips_eval.csv): path to the Cloud evaluation dataset
* [LOCAL_TAXI_TRAINING](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-samples-data/ml-engine/chicago_taxi/local/taxi_trips_train.csv): path to the Local training dataset
* [LOCAL_TAXI_EVALUATION](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-samples-data/ml-engine/chicago_taxi/local/taxi_trips_eval.csv): path to the Local evaluation dataset
