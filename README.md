[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Welcome to the [AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/) sample code repository. This repository contains samples for how to use AI Platform products.

## Overview

The repository is organized by products: 

 - [AI Platform Training](training)
 - [AI Platform Prediction](prediction)
 
<!--
 Commenting these out until we have at least a sample for them in the repo:
 - [AI Platform Notebooks](notebooks)
 - [Deep Learning VM Images](dlvm)
 - [Data Label Services](https://cloud.google.com/data-labeling/docs/)
 - [Built-in Algorithms](built_in_algorithms)
 -->

## Getting Started

We highly recommend that you start with our [Quick Start Sample](./quickstart).

## Navigating this Repository

This repository is organized based on the available products on AI Platform, and the typical Machine Learning problems 
that developers are trying to solve. For instance, if you are trying to train a model with scikit-learn, 
you will find the sample under [training/sklearn/structured/base](./training/sklearn/structured/base) directory.

Please refer to the `README` file in each sample directory for more specific instructions.
